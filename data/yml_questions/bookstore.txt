    Description:
    The Bookstore API is a set of APIs that allow users to manage books and authors in a bookstore. The API provides endpoints for listing all available books and authors, retrieving details of a specific book or author, creating new books and authors, updating existing books and authors, and deleting books and authors.

The '/books' endpoint supports GET and POST methods. The GET method returns a list of all available books in the store, with each book having properties like id, title, author (an Author object), description, and published date. The POST method creates a new book in the store, and the request body should contain a BookInput object with properties like title, authorId, description, and published date.

The '/books/{bookId}' endpoint supports GET, PUT, and DELETE methods. The GET method retrieves a single book by its id. The PUT method updates an existing book by its id, and the request body should contain a BookInput object with the updated properties. The DELETE method deletes an existing book by its id.

The '/authors' endpoint supports GET and POST methods, similar to '/books'. The GET method returns a list of all authors, with each author having properties like id, name, and biography. The POST method creates a new author, and the request body should contain an AuthorInput object with properties like name and biography.

The '/authors/{authorId}' endpoint supports GET, PUT, and DELETE methods, similar to '/books/{bookId}', but for managing authors instead of books.

Possible errors and limits:
- Not providing required properties in the request body for POST and PUT methods.
- Attempting to retrieve, update, or delete a non-existing book or author.
- Exceeding rate limits or triggering abuse prevention mechanisms.
