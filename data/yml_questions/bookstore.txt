    Description:
    The Bookstore API provides a set of endpoints to manage books and authors in a bookstore. It allows users to list all available books and authors, create new books and authors, retrieve details of a specific book or author, update existing books and authors, and delete books and authors.

The /books endpoint supports GET, POST, GET /{bookId}, PUT /{bookId}, and DELETE /{bookId} operations. The GET method returns a list of all available books, while the POST method creates a new book. The GET /{bookId} retrieves details of a specific book, the PUT /{bookId} updates an existing book, and the DELETE /{bookId} deletes a book. The request and response data structures for book-related operations are defined by the Book and BookInput models.

The /authors endpoint supports GET, POST, GET /{authorId}, PUT /{authorId}, and DELETE /{authorId} operations, which work similarly to the book-related operations but for managing authors instead. The request and response data structures for author-related operations are defined by the Author and AuthorInput models.

The API responses use standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure, such as 200 for successful GET requests, 201 for successful POST requests, 204 for successful DELETE requests, and appropriate error codes for failed requests. Common errors may include bad request (400), unauthorized (401), not found (404), and internal server error (500).

    FAQ:
    
    What is the Bookstore API?

The Bookstore API is a set of endpoints that allows you to manage books and authors in a bookstore. It provides functionality to list, create, retrieve, update, and delete books and authors.

How do I get a list of all available books?

To get a list of all available books, send a GET request to the /books endpoint. The response will be an array of Book objects containing details of each book.

What information is included in the Book object?

The Book object contains the following properties: id (integer), title (string), author (Author object), description (string), and published (date string).

How do I create a new book?

To create a new book, send a POST request to the /books endpoint with a request body containing a BookInput object. The BookInput object should include the title (string), authorId (integer), description (string), and published (date string) properties.

What is the purpose of the authorId property in the BookInput object?

The authorId property in the BookInput object is used to associate the new book with an existing author. It should be set to the ID of the author you want to assign to the book.

How do I get details of a specific book?

To get details of a specific book, send a GET request to the /books/{bookId} endpoint, where {bookId} is the ID of the book you want to retrieve. The response will be a Book object containing the details of the requested book.

How do I update an existing book?

To update an existing book, send a PUT request to the /books/{bookId} endpoint, where {bookId} is the ID of the book you want to update. The request body should contain a BookInput object with the updated properties.

How do I delete a book?

To delete a book, send a DELETE request to the /books/{bookId} endpoint, where {bookId} is the ID of the book you want to delete. If successful, the response will have a 204 status code.

What endpoints are available for managing authors?

The Bookstore API provides the following endpoints for managing authors: GET /authors (list all authors), POST /authors (create a new author), GET /authors/{authorId} (get details of an author), PUT /authors/{authorId} (update an author), and DELETE /authors/{authorId} (delete an author).

What information is included in the Author object?

The Author object contains the following properties: id (integer), name (string), and biography (string).

How do I create a new author?

To create a new author, send a POST request to the /authors endpoint with a request body containing an AuthorInput object. The AuthorInput object should include the name (string) and biography (string) properties.

What HTTP status codes are used in the API responses?

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure. Common status codes include 200 (successful GET request), 201 (successful POST request), 204 (successful DELETE request), 400 (bad request), 401 (unauthorized), 404 (not found), and 500 (internal server error).

How do I handle errors in the API responses?

You should check the HTTP status code in the API response to determine if the request was successful or not. If the status code indicates an error (e.g., 400, 401, 404, 500), you can inspect the response body for more details about the error.

Can I filter or sort the list of books or authors?

The Bookstore API does not currently support filtering or sorting of the book and author lists. It simply returns all available books or authors without any additional query parameters.

Is there a limit on the number of books or authors I can create?

The API documentation does not specify any limits on the number of books or authors that can be created. However, it's possible that the underlying implementation may impose limits based on available storage or other factors.

How do I handle dates in the API requests and responses?

The API uses the date string format for date properties, such as the published property in the Book and BookInput models. You should follow the specified format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) when sending or receiving date values.

Can I update the author associated with an existing book?

No, the API does not provide a direct way to update the author associated with an existing book. To change the author, you would need to create a new book with the desired author and delete the old book.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for the API?

The API documentation does not mention any rate limits or throttling mechanisms. However, it's a common practice for APIs to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or excessive load.

How do I authenticate and authorize requests to the API?

The API documentation does not provide any information about authentication and authorization mechanisms. It's possible that the API may require some form of authentication, such as API keys or OAuth, but the details are not specified in the provided YAML file.

Can I perform batch operations, such as creating or updating multiple books or authors in a single request?

The API documentation does not mention any support for batch operations. The endpoints seem to be designed to handle individual book or author resources through separate requests.
