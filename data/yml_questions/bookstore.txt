    Description:
    The Bookstore API is a set of endpoints that allow users to manage a collection of books and authors. The API provides functionality to list all available books and authors, retrieve details of a specific book or author, create new books and authors, update existing books and authors, and delete books and authors.

The /books endpoint supports GET and POST requests. GET requests return a list of all books in the store. POST requests are used to create a new book by providing a BookInput object in the request body, containing the title, authorId, description, and published date of the book. The /books/{bookId} endpoint supports GET, PUT, and DELETE requests. GET requests retrieve the details of a specific book identified by the bookId path parameter. PUT requests update an existing book by providing a BookInput object in the request body. DELETE requests delete a book identified by the bookId path parameter.

The /authors endpoint supports GET and POST requests. GET requests return a list of all authors. POST requests create a new author by providing an AuthorInput object in the request body, containing the name and biography of the author. The /authors/{authorId} endpoint supports GET, PUT, and DELETE requests. GET requests retrieve the details of a specific author identified by the authorId path parameter. PUT requests update an existing author by providing an AuthorInput object in the request body. DELETE requests delete an author identified by the authorId path parameter.

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. For example, a 200 OK response indicates a successful GET request, a 201 Created response indicates a successful POST request, and a 204 No Content response indicates a successful DELETE request. Error responses may include appropriate error codes and messages.

Limits and frequent errors may include validation errors for invalid or missing request data, unauthorized access errors, and resource not found errors if an invalid book or author ID is provided.
