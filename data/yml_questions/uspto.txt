    Description:
    The USPTO Data Set API (DSAPI) is a RESTful API that allows public users to discover and search USPTO exported data sets. The API consists of two main endpoints: a GET endpoint for retrieving metadata about available data sets and their searchable fields, and a POST endpoint for performing searches on a specific data set based on specified criteria.

The GET endpoint (/{dataset}/{version}/fields) retrieves a list of searchable field names for a given data set and version. For example, calling /oa_citations/v1/fields will return an array of field names that can be used to query the 'oa_citations' data set. This endpoint helps users understand the structure and searchable properties of a data set before performing actual searches.

The POST endpoint (/{dataset}/{version}/records) allows users to search a data set by specifying a set of search criteria using the Lucene Query Syntax. The request body should include the 'criteria' property with the desired search query, as well as optional 'start' and 'rows' properties to control the starting record number and number of results to return. The response contains an array of matching records, where each record is an object with key-value pairs representing the data set's fields and their corresponding values.

It's important to note that the POST request uses the application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type for the request body, which may impose size limitations on the search criteria. Additionally, the API may return a 404 error if the specified data set or version is not found or published for public consumption.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the USPTO Data Set API (DSAPI)?

The USPTO Data Set API is a RESTful API that allows public users to discover and search USPTO exported data sets. It provides a way to programmatically access and query various data sets published by the USPTO.

How do I get a list of available data sets?

You can send a GET request to the root endpoint (/) to retrieve a list of available data sets, along with their API keys, version numbers, and URLs for accessing metadata and documentation.

How do I find out what fields are searchable in a particular data set?

You can send a GET request to the /{dataset}/{version}/fields endpoint, replacing {dataset} and {version} with the appropriate values for the data set you're interested in. This will return a list of searchable field names for that data set and version.

What is the format for specifying search criteria when querying a data set?

The API uses the Lucene Query Syntax for specifying search criteria. You can construct queries using field names, values, ranges, and boolean operators. For example, 'title:patent' would search for records where the 'title' field contains the word 'patent'.

How do I perform a search on a data set?

You can send a POST request to the /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoint, replacing {dataset} and {version} with the appropriate values for the data set you want to search. The request body should include the 'criteria' property with your search query, and optionally the 'start' and 'rows' properties to control the result set.

What is the format of the response when searching a data set?

The response will be a JSON array, where each element is an object representing a matching record. The keys of each object correspond to the field names in the data set, and the values are the field values for that particular record.

What happens if I specify an invalid data set or version in the request URL?

If the combination of data set name and version is not found or not published for public consumption, the API will return a 404 error response.

Are there any limitations on the size of the search criteria I can specify in the POST request?

Yes, since the API expects the request body to be in application/x-www-form-urlencoded format, there may be size limitations on the search criteria you can specify. Complex or large queries may need to be split into multiple requests.

How can I learn more about the Lucene Query Syntax used for specifying search criteria?

The API documentation provides a link to the Lucene Query Syntax documentation: https://lucene.apache.org/core/3_6_2/queryparsersyntax.html#Overview. You can refer to this documentation for more details and examples on constructing search queries.

Can I search for ranges of values in a particular field?

Yes, the Lucene Query Syntax supports searching for ranges of values using the square bracket notation. For example, 'publicationDate:[20200101 TO 20201231]' would search for records where the 'publicationDate' field falls within the specified date range.

What happens if my search query doesn't match any records in the data set?

If there are no matching records for the specified search criteria, the API will return a 404 error response with the message 'No matching record found for the given criteria'.

How can I control the number of results returned by a search query?

You can specify the 'start' and 'rows' properties in the request body to control the starting record number and the maximum number of rows to return, respectively. If you don't specify these values, the API will use the default values of 0 for 'start' and 100 for 'rows'.

Is there a way to get the total number of records in a data set?

Yes, when you perform a search with the default values (start=0, rows=100), the response will include a 'numFound' attribute that tells you the total number of records available in the data set.

Can I combine multiple search criteria in a single query?

Yes, the Lucene Query Syntax allows you to combine multiple search criteria using boolean operators like AND, OR, and NOT. For example, 'title:patent AND inventor:smith' would search for records where the title contains 'patent' and the inventor is 'smith'.

How can I handle errors or unexpected responses from the API?

The API documentation outlines the possible error responses, such as 404 for not found resources. It's important to implement proper error handling in your client code to gracefully handle and respond to different error scenarios.

Is there a way to test or explore the API before integrating it into my application?

Yes, the API documentation provides URLs for an API console (e.g., https://developer.uspto.gov/ds-api-docs/index.html?url=https://developer.uspto.gov/ds-api/swagger/docs/oa_citations.json) where you can interact with the API endpoints and test various requests and responses.

Can I use this API to modify or update data sets?

No, the USPTO Data Set API is a read-only API that allows you to search and retrieve data from published data sets. It does not provide functionality for modifying or updating the underlying data.

Are there any rate limits or usage restrictions for the API?

The API documentation does not mention any specific rate limits or usage restrictions. However, it's generally a good practice to implement responsible usage patterns and avoid overwhelming the API with excessive requests.

How can I stay updated with any changes or new features in the API?

The API documentation provides contact information (name, URL, and email) for the Open Data Portal team at the USPTO. You can reach out to them for any updates, changes, or new features related to the Data Set API.
