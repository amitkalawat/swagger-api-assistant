If you try to retrieve or delete a pet that you don't have access to, the API will respond with an error, likely with a 403 Forbidden status code.

The pet IDs are expected to be integers in the int64 format, which can represent very large integer values.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for this API?

The OpenAPI specification does not specify any restrictions on the types of pets that can be managed using this API, so it's likely that it can be used for various types of pets, not just dogs and cats.
