    Description:
    This API specification defines a set of endpoints for managing a petstore system. The main endpoints are:

- GET /pets: Retrieves a list of pets available in the system. It takes optional query parameters 'tags' (an array of strings to filter pets by tag) and 'limit' (an integer to limit the number of results). The response is an array of 'Pet' objects.

- POST /pets: Creates a new pet in the system. The request body should contain a 'NewPet' object with the required 'name' property and optional 'tag' property. The response is the created 'Pet' object.

- GET /pets/{id}: Retrieves a specific pet by its ID. The ID is passed as a path parameter. The response is the 'Pet' object.

- DELETE /pets/{id}: Deletes a specific pet by its ID. The ID is passed as a path parameter. The response is a 204 status code on success.

The data models used are:
- Pet: Represents a pet with an ID, name, and tag.
- NewPet: Represents the data required to create a new pet, with a name and optional tag.
- Error: Represents an error response with a code and message.

Potential errors include returning the default 'Error' response for unexpected issues, or returning a 400 Bad Request if required data is missing from requests.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this API?

This API allows you to manage pets in a petstore system. You can retrieve a list of available pets, create new pets, get details of a specific pet, and delete a pet.

How do I get a list of all pets?

To get a list of all pets, send a GET request to the /pets endpoint. You can optionally filter the results by specifying tags in the 'tags' query parameter and limit the number of results with the 'limit' query parameter.

What data is required to create a new pet?

To create a new pet, send a POST request to the /pets endpoint with a request body containing a 'NewPet' object. The 'NewPet' object must have a 'name' property, and can optionally include a 'tag' property.

How do I get details of a specific pet?

To get details of a specific pet, send a GET request to the /pets/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the pet you want to retrieve.

How do I delete a pet?

To delete a pet, send a DELETE request to the /pets/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the pet you want to delete.

What does the 'Pet' object contain?

The 'Pet' object contains an ID, name, and tag. The ID is an integer, the name is a string, and the tag is an optional string.

What is the purpose of the 'Error' object?

The 'Error' object is used to represent an error response from the API. It contains a code (an integer) and a message (a string) describing the error.

Can I create multiple pets with the same name?

Yes, the API allows creating duplicate pets with the same name.

What happens if I try to retrieve a pet that doesn't exist?

If you try to retrieve a pet with an ID that doesn't exist, the API will likely return an 'Error' object with an appropriate error code and message.

Are there any limits on the number of pets I can create?

The API documentation doesn't mention any specific limits on the number of pets that can be created. However, there may be system limits or resource constraints that could impose practical limits.

How do I handle errors from the API?

Errors from the API are represented by the 'Error' object, which contains a code and message. You should check the response for an 'Error' object and handle the error accordingly based on the code and message.

Can I update an existing pet?

The API specification doesn't appear to include an endpoint for updating existing pets. You would need to delete the existing pet and create a new one with the updated data.

What is the format of the pet ID?

The pet ID is an integer in int64 format.

Are there any authentication requirements for using this API?

The API specification doesn't mention any authentication requirements, so it's likely that the API is public and doesn't require authentication.

Can I filter the list of pets by multiple tags?

Yes, the 'tags' query parameter for the GET /pets endpoint accepts an array of strings, so you can filter by multiple tags.

What happens if I try to create a pet without providing a name?

The 'name' property is required for creating a new pet. If you try to create a pet without providing a name, the API will likely return an error response indicating that the request is invalid.

Are there any validations on the 'tag' property when creating a new pet?

The API specification doesn't mention any specific validations or constraints on the 'tag' property. It is likely that any string value is accepted as a valid tag.

Can I get a list of all available tags in the system?

The API specification doesn't include an endpoint for retrieving a list of available tags. You would need to derive the available tags from the 'tag' properties of the 'Pet' objects returned by the GET /pets endpoint.

What is the purpose of the 'termsOfService' field in the API specification?

The 'termsOfService' field is part of the API metadata and provides a URL or reference to the terms of service for using the API. It helps inform API consumers about any legal or usage agreements.

How can I contribute to the development or documentation of this API?

The API specification includes contact information for the Swagger API Team, including an email address (apiteam@swagger.io) and a website URL (http://swagger.io). You can reach out to them regarding contributions or feedback.
