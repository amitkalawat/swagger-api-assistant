    Description:
    The provided OpenAPI specification defines a set of APIs for managing pets in a pet store. The APIs allow users to retrieve a list of pets, create a new pet, get details of a specific pet by ID, and delete a pet by ID. The requests and responses use JSON data structures. The `/pets` endpoint supports GET and POST methods to retrieve a list of pets and create a new pet, respectively. The GET method accepts optional query parameters `tags` (an array of strings to filter pets by tags) and `limit` (an integer representing the maximum number of results to return). The POST method requires a request body with a `NewPet` object containing the `name` and `tag` properties. The `/pets/{id}` endpoint supports GET and DELETE methods to retrieve a pet by ID and delete a pet by ID, respectively. The GET method takes an `id` path parameter representing the pet ID. The DELETE method also takes an `id` path parameter. Successful responses include the requested pet data or a success status code (204 for DELETE). Error responses contain an `Error` object with a `code` and `message` property. Potential errors include invalid inputs, resource not found, and other unexpected errors.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this API?

This API provides functionality for managing pets in a pet store. It allows users to retrieve a list of pets, create new pets, get details of a specific pet, and delete a pet.

How do I get a list of all pets?

To get a list of all pets, send a GET request to the `/pets` endpoint. You can optionally include query parameters `tags` and `limit` to filter the results or limit the number of pets returned.

What data is required to create a new pet?

To create a new pet, send a POST request to the `/pets` endpoint with a request body containing a `NewPet` object. The `NewPet` object must include the `name` property, and can optionally include the `tag` property.

How do I get details of a specific pet?

To get details of a specific pet, send a GET request to the `/pets/{id}` endpoint, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the pet you want to retrieve.

How do I delete a pet?

To delete a pet, send a DELETE request to the `/pets/{id}` endpoint, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the pet you want to delete.

What is the format of the response data?

The response data is in JSON format. Successful responses for GET requests include a `Pet` object or an array of `Pet` objects. Error responses include an `Error` object with a `code` and `message` property.

What is the structure of the `Pet` object?

The `Pet` object has an `id` property (integer) and inherits properties from the `NewPet` object, which includes `name` (string) and `tag` (string).

What is the structure of the `Error` object?

The `Error` object has a `code` property (integer) and a `message` property (string) that provide information about the error that occurred.

What are the possible error responses?

The API can return an `Error` object in case of invalid inputs, resource not found, or other unexpected errors. The `code` and `message` properties of the `Error` object provide details about the error.

Can I filter the list of pets by tags?

Yes, you can filter the list of pets by tags by including the `tags` query parameter with an array of tag strings in the GET request to the `/pets` endpoint.

Can I limit the number of pets returned in the response?

Yes, you can limit the number of pets returned in the response by including the `limit` query parameter with an integer value in the GET request to the `/pets` endpoint.

What happens if I try to create a pet without providing the required `name` property?

If you try to create a pet without providing the required `name` property in the `NewPet` object, the API will likely return an `Error` response indicating that the request is invalid or missing required data.

What happens if I try to get details of a pet that doesn't exist?

If you try to get details of a pet by sending a GET request to `/pets/{id}` with an `id` that doesn't exist, the API will likely return an `Error` response indicating that the requested resource was not found.

Can I update an existing pet's information?

The provided API specification does not include an endpoint for updating an existing pet's information. It only allows for creating, retrieving, and deleting pets.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for this API?

The API specification does not mention any rate limits or throttling mechanisms. However, it is a common practice to implement such mechanisms to prevent abuse or overload of the API.

Can I use this API to manage other types of data besides pets?

This API is specifically designed for managing pets in a pet store. To manage other types of data, you would need a separate API designed for that purpose.

How can I authenticate with this API?

The API specification does not include any information about authentication mechanisms. It is possible that authentication is handled separately or that this API is intended for public use without authentication.

Are there any known issues or limitations with this API?

The API specification does not mention any known issues or limitations. However, it is always a good practice to test the API thoroughly and refer to any additional documentation or support resources provided by the API provider.

Can I use this API in my production environment?

The decision to use this API in a production environment would depend on factors such as the reliability, performance, and security requirements of your application, as well as any terms of service or licensing agreements associated with the API.
