    Description:
    The provided OpenAPI specification defines a set of APIs for working with users, repositories, and pull requests on a code hosting platform like Bitbucket. The '/2.0/users/{username}' endpoint allows retrieving information about a specific user by their username. The response includes a link to the repositories owned by the user. The '/2.0/repositories/{username}' endpoint retrieves a list of repositories owned by a particular user, identified by their username. Each repository object in the response contains a link to its details. The '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}' endpoint retrieves details of a specific repository, identified by the owner's username and the repository slug. The response includes a link to the pull requests associated with that repository. The '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests' endpoint retrieves a list of pull requests for a specific repository, optionally filtering by their state (open, merged, or declined). The '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}' endpoint retrieves details of a specific pull request, identified by its ID, the repository's owner username, and slug. The response includes a link to merge the pull request. The '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}/merge' endpoint allows merging a specific pull request by sending a POST request with the repository owner's username, slug, and pull request ID. Errors may occur if required parameters are missing or invalid, or if the requested resource is not found.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of these APIs?

These APIs allow interacting with users, repositories, and pull requests on a code hosting platform like Bitbucket.

How do I retrieve information about a specific user?

Send a GET request to the '/2.0/users/{username}' endpoint, replacing '{username}' with the desired username. The response will contain details about the user.

How do I get a list of repositories owned by a user?

Send a GET request to the '/2.0/repositories/{username}' endpoint, replacing '{username}' with the desired username. The response will be an array of repository objects owned by that user.

What information is included in a repository object?

A repository object contains properties such as the repository's slug and the owner's user object.

How do I retrieve details of a specific repository?

Send a GET request to the '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}' endpoint, replacing '{username}' with the repository owner's username and '{slug}' with the repository's slug.

What is a link object and how is it used?

A link object provides a way to link to related resources or actions. For example, the response for a repository includes a link to retrieve its pull requests.

How do I retrieve pull requests for a repository?

Send a GET request to the '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests' endpoint, replacing '{username}' and '{slug}' with the repository's owner username and slug, respectively. You can optionally include a 'state' query parameter to filter by pull request state.

What information is included in a pull request object?

A pull request object contains properties such as its ID, title, the associated repository object, and the author's user object.

How do I retrieve details of a specific pull request?

Send a GET request to the '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}' endpoint, replacing '{username}' and '{slug}' with the repository's owner username and slug, and '{pid}' with the pull request ID.

How do I merge a pull request?

Send a POST request to the '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}/merge' endpoint, replacing '{username}' and '{slug}' with the repository's owner username and slug, and '{pid}' with the pull request ID.

What happens if I provide an invalid username or slug?

If the provided username or slug is invalid or does not exist, the API will likely return a 404 Not Found error.

What happens if I try to merge a pull request that is not in an open state?

The API may return an error if you attempt to merge a pull request that is not in an open state.

Are there any limits on the number of pull requests I can retrieve?

The API specification does not mention any limits, but it is possible that the platform imposes limits on the number of pull requests that can be retrieved in a single request.

Can I create or update users, repositories, or pull requests using these APIs?

No, these APIs only allow retrieving information about existing users, repositories, and pull requests. Creating or updating resources is not supported.

What is the format of the response data?

The response data is in JSON format, as specified by the 'application/json' content type in the API specification.

How do I handle errors from these APIs?

The API specification does not provide detailed error handling information, but typically, an error will be indicated by a non-2xx HTTP status code, and the response body may contain additional error details.

Are there any authentication or authorization requirements for these APIs?

The API specification does not mention any authentication or authorization requirements, but it is likely that some form of authentication (e.g., API key or token) is required to access these APIs in a production environment.

Can I use these APIs for purposes other than code hosting?

While these APIs are designed for a code hosting platform like Bitbucket, some of the concepts (e.g., users, repositories, pull requests) may be applicable to other platforms or systems that deal with similar entities.

How do I interpret the response links?

The response links provide information on how to navigate to related resources or actions. For example, the 'userRepositories' link in the response for a user object tells you how to retrieve the repositories owned by that user.

Are there any special considerations for working with pull requests?

When working with pull requests, you may need to handle different states (open, merged, declined) and ensure that you only attempt to merge open pull requests. Additionally, you may want to check for permissions or access control before merging a pull request.
