    Description:
    The Flowershop API provides a set of endpoints for managing flowers available in a flower shop. The `/flowers` endpoint allows retrieving a list of all available flowers, optionally filtering by type and limiting the number of results. It also supports adding a new flower to the shop by sending a POST request with the flower details. The `/flowers/{id}` endpoint retrieves a specific flower by its ID and allows deleting a flower by sending a DELETE request with the flower ID. The API uses standard HTTP status codes for responses, including 200 for successful requests, 204 for successful deletions, and default error responses with an error code and message. Request and response data structures are defined for flowers, new flowers, and errors.
