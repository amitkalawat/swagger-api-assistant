    Description:
    The Flowershop API provides a set of endpoints for managing the operations of a flower shop. The API allows you to retrieve a list of all available flowers, optionally filtered by type and with a limit on the number of results. You can also add a new flower by sending a POST request with the flower's details, such as name, type, and price. Individual flowers can be retrieved or deleted by their ID. The API follows the typical RESTful conventions and uses JSON for request and response payloads. Possible errors, such as unexpected exceptions, are returned with appropriate error codes and messages.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the base URL of the Flowershop API?

The base URL of the Flowershop API is https://api.example.com/v1, as specified in the 'servers' section of the OpenAPI specification.

How do I retrieve a list of all available flowers?

To retrieve a list of all available flowers, send a GET request to the /flowers endpoint. The response will be an array of Flower objects.

Can I filter the list of flowers by type?

Yes, you can filter the list of flowers by type by including the 'type' query parameter in the GET /flowers request. The value of this parameter should be an array of strings representing the flower types you want to include.

How do I limit the number of results returned by the GET /flowers endpoint?

To limit the number of results returned by the GET /flowers endpoint, include the 'limit' query parameter in the request. The value of this parameter should be an integer representing the maximum number of results you want to receive.

What is the data structure of a Flower object?

A Flower object has the following properties: id (integer), name (string), type (string), and price (float). The id property is required and assigned by the server, while the other properties are required in the request body when adding a new flower.

How do I add a new flower to the shop?

To add a new flower to the shop, send a POST request to the /flowers endpoint with a request body containing a NewFlower object. The NewFlower object should have the name, type, and price properties set with the appropriate values for the new flower.

What is the structure of the NewFlower object?

The NewFlower object has three required properties: name (string), type (string), and price (float). This object is used in the request body when adding a new flower to the shop.

How do I retrieve a specific flower by its ID?

To retrieve a specific flower by its ID, send a GET request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the integer ID of the flower you want to retrieve.

How do I delete a flower from the shop?

To delete a flower from the shop, send a DELETE request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the integer ID of the flower you want to delete.

What is the structure of the Error response object?

The Error response object has two required properties: code (integer) and message (string). This object is returned in the response when an unexpected error occurs.

What HTTP status code is returned when a flower is successfully deleted?

When a flower is successfully deleted, the API returns an HTTP status code of 204 (No Content).

Are there any validation rules for the flower name or type?

The OpenAPI specification does not mention any specific validation rules for the flower name or type properties. However, it is generally a good practice to enforce appropriate validation rules on the server-side to ensure data integrity.

Can I update an existing flower's details?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not include an endpoint for updating an existing flower's details. To update a flower, you would typically need to send a PUT or PATCH request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint with the updated flower data in the request body.

What happens if I try to retrieve a flower with an invalid ID?

If you try to retrieve a flower with an invalid ID using the GET /flowers/{id} endpoint, the API will likely return an Error response object with an appropriate error code and message, indicating that the requested flower was not found.

Are there any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms in place for the API?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not mention any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for the Flowershop API. However, it is a common practice to implement such mechanisms to protect the server from excessive load or abuse.

Can I use this API to manage inventory or stock levels of the flowers?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not include any endpoints or data models related to managing inventory or stock levels of the flowers. The API is focused solely on managing the basic CRUD operations for flowers.

Is there any way to retrieve information about the shop itself, such as its address or contact details?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not include any endpoints or data models for retrieving information about the flower shop itself. The API is focused exclusively on managing the flowers available in the shop.

How do I handle authentication or authorization for the API endpoints?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not mention any authentication or authorization mechanisms for the Flowershop API endpoints. Typically, APIs require some form of authentication, such as API keys or OAuth, to secure access to the endpoints. You would need to implement and document these mechanisms separately.

Are there any specific error codes or messages I should be prepared to handle?

The OpenAPI specification does not provide details on specific error codes or messages that may be returned by the Flowershop API, except for the general Error response object. You should be prepared to handle common HTTP status codes, such as 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error), and handle any error messages accordingly.
