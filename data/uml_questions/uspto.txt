    Description:
    The provided images depict the structure and endpoints of a set of APIs for managing datasets and performing searches. The API has three main endpoints: GET /datasets to list available datasets, GET /{dataset}/{version}/fields to retrieve searchable fields for a given dataset and version, and POST /{dataset}/{version}/records to perform a search on a dataset and version. The GET /datasets endpoint returns a list of dataset IDs, while the other two endpoints require the dataset and version identifiers. The GET /{dataset}/{version}/fields endpoint returns a list of searchable fields (with HTTP status 200 for success or 404 for not found). The POST /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoint takes a request body with search criteria (criteria, start, and rows fields) and returns the search results (with HTTP status 200 for success or 404 for not found). The API also includes data models for representing datasets, searchable fields, and search responses.
    - Number of routes/endpoints: 3 (GET /datasets, GET /{dataset}/{version}/fields, POST /{dataset}/{version}/records)
- Number of request data models: 1 (perform-search Request)
- Number of response data models: 3 (list-searchable-fields 200, list-searchable-fields 404, perform-search 200, perform-search 404)
- The API has a dataSetList model representing the list of available datasets
- The API has a dataSetList.apis model with details about each dataset API
    
    FAQ:
    
    What does this API do?

This API provides functionality for managing datasets and performing searches on those datasets.

How do I get a list of available datasets?

You can use the GET /datasets endpoint to retrieve a list of dataset IDs.

How do I get the searchable fields for a dataset?

Use the GET /{dataset}/{version}/fields endpoint, providing the dataset and version identifiers. The response will include a list of searchable fields for that dataset version.

What is the purpose of the POST /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoint?

This endpoint allows you to perform a search on a specific dataset and version. You need to provide the dataset and version identifiers, along with search criteria in the request body.

What fields are required in the request body for the POST /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoint?

The request body should include the following fields: criteria (a string representing the search criteria), start (an integer indicating the starting index for the search results), and rows (an integer specifying the maximum number of results to return).

What happens if I provide an invalid dataset or version identifier?

If the provided dataset or version identifier is invalid, the GET /{dataset}/{version}/fields and POST /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoints will return an HTTP 404 Not Found error.

How are the search results returned from the POST /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoint?

The search results are returned in the response body as a map (value field) containing the search results data.

Are there any limits on the number of search results that can be returned?

The API documentation doesn't mention any explicit limits on the number of search results that can be returned. However, you can control the maximum number of results by specifying the rows field in the request body.

How can I get more information about a specific dataset API?

The API includes a dataSetList.apis model that contains details about each dataset API, such as the API key, version number, URI, and documentation URI.

What data types are used for the various fields in the API?

The API uses strings for dataset identifiers, version identifiers, search criteria, and field names. Integers are used for representing total counts (e.g., total number of datasets) and indices (e.g., start index for search results).

Can I search across multiple datasets at once?

No, the API seems to only support searching within a single dataset and version at a time. You would need to make separate requests for each dataset and version combination.

How do I handle errors or exceptional cases when using this API?

The API returns standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found) for error cases. You should check the status code in the response and handle errors accordingly in your application code.

Is there any authentication or authorization required to use this API?

The provided documentation doesn't mention any authentication or authorization requirements. However, in a real-world scenario, APIs often require some form of authentication, such as API keys or OAuth tokens.

Can I filter or sort the search results returned by the POST /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoint?

The documentation doesn't specify any filtering or sorting capabilities for the search results. It seems that the results are returned as is based on the provided search criteria.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for this API?

The documentation doesn't mention any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms. However, it's common for APIs to have rate limits in place to prevent abuse or overload.

How can I test or explore this API before integrating it into my application?

Many APIs provide interactive documentation (e.g., Swagger UI) or testing tools (e.g., Postman collections) that allow you to try out the endpoints and see sample responses before integrating the API into your application.

Are there any versioning strategies or guidelines for this API?

The API includes a version identifier for datasets, suggesting that versioning is supported. However, the documentation doesn't provide details on versioning strategies or guidelines for handling breaking changes.

Can I get real-time updates or notifications when new datasets become available?

The documentation doesn't mention any real-time update or notification mechanisms. You would likely need to periodically poll the GET /datasets endpoint to check for new datasets.

Are there any performance considerations or best practices for using this API efficiently?

Without more context or details about the API's implementation, it's difficult to provide specific performance considerations or best practices. However, general API performance best practices include caching, pagination, and efficient use of resources.

How can I contribute to or provide feedback on this API?

The documentation doesn't provide any information on contributing to or providing feedback for this API. In a real-world scenario, APIs often have channels for user feedback, bug reports, or feature requests.
