    Description:
    This API specification defines a set of endpoints for managing pull requests, repositories, and users in a version control system. The '/pullrequests' endpoints allow users to retrieve pull requests by repository or by ID, merge pull requests, and get repositories owned by a user. The '/repositories/{username}' endpoints provide access to a user's repositories and personal information. Request data models include 'username', 'slug', 'state', and 'pid' parameters for filtering and identifying resources. Response data models contain details about pull requests, repositories, and users. Potential errors include invalid parameters or resource not found.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this API?

This API provides endpoints for managing pull requests, repositories, and user information in a version control system.

How do I retrieve a list of pull requests for a specific repository?

Send a GET request to '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests' with the 'username' and 'slug' parameters identifying the repository.

What information is included in the response for a pull request?

The response contains a 'pullrequest' object with an 'id' and 'title' property, representing the unique identifier and title of the pull request.

How can I merge a pull request?

Send a POST request to '/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}/merge' with the 'username', 'slug', and 'pid' parameters identifying the repository and pull request ID.

What does the 'state' parameter represent in the '/pullrequests' endpoint?

The 'state' parameter is an optional string that allows filtering pull requests by their state (e.g., 'OPEN', 'MERGED', 'DECLINED').

How do I retrieve a user's repositories?

Send a GET request to '/2.0/repositories/{username}' with the 'username' parameter identifying the user.

What information is included in the response for a repository?

The response contains a 'repository' object with a 'slug' property, representing the unique identifier or name of the repository.

How can I get information about a specific user?

Send a GET request to '/2.0/users/{username}' with the 'username' parameter identifying the user.

What information is included in the response for a user?

The response contains a 'user' object with 'username' and 'uuid' properties, representing the user's username and unique identifier.

Are there any limitations on the number of pull requests or repositories I can retrieve?

The API documentation doesn't mention any specific limits, but it's always best to implement pagination and rate limiting to avoid overloading the server.

What happens if I provide an invalid 'username' or 'slug' parameter?

If the provided 'username' or 'slug' parameter doesn't match any existing user or repository, the API will likely return a 404 Not Found error.

Can I create or delete pull requests or repositories using this API?

Based on the provided API specification, there are no endpoints for creating or deleting pull requests or repositories. The API is read-only and focused on retrieving and merging existing resources.

How can I handle errors returned by the API?

The API responses should include appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in case of failures or invalid requests. You'll need to implement error handling in your client code based on the specific error codes and messages returned.

Is there any way to filter or sort the pull requests retrieved from the '/pullrequests' endpoint?

The API specification doesn't mention any additional filtering or sorting options for pull requests beyond the 'state' parameter. You may need to handle sorting and advanced filtering on the client side.

Can I access pull request comments or commit information through this API?

No, the provided API specification doesn't include any endpoints or data models related to pull request comments or commit information. It's focused on basic pull request, repository, and user data.

How can I authenticate with this API?

The API specification doesn't provide any details about authentication methods. Typically, APIs require some form of authentication, such as API keys or OAuth tokens, which should be included in the request headers or as query parameters.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for this API?

The API specification doesn't mention any specific rate limiting or throttling mechanisms. However, it's a common practice for APIs to implement rate limiting to protect against abuse or excessive load.

Can I access historical data or audit logs through this API?
