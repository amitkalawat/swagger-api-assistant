    Description:
    The APIs represent a flower management system. The 'findFlowers' API retrieves a list of flowers, with optional path parameters for filtering and limiting the results. The 'findFlowerById' API retrieves details of a specific flower by its ID. The 'addFlower' API allows creating a new flower by providing its name, type, and price in the request body. The 'deleteFlower' API deletes a flower by its ID. The response codes include 200 for successful GET requests, 201 for successful POST requests, 204 for successful DELETE requests, and error responses with appropriate codes and messages for failures.
    - Number of routes/endpoints: 4 (findFlowers, findFlowerById, addFlower, deleteFlower)
- Number of request data models: 2 (findFlowers, addFlower)
- Number of response data models: 3 (findFlowers, findFlowerById, deleteFlower)
- Number of path parameters: 3 (findFlowers, findFlowerById, deleteFlower)
    
    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of the APIs?

The APIs provide functionality for managing a collection of flowers, allowing retrieval, addition, and deletion of flower data.

How can I retrieve a list of all flowers?

You can use the 'findFlowers' API with a GET request to retrieve a list of all flowers.

Can I filter the list of flowers returned by the 'findFlowers' API?

Yes, you can use the 'path' query parameter to filter the list of flowers by their names or other attributes.

How can I limit the number of flowers returned by the 'findFlowers' API?

You can use the 'limit' query parameter to specify the maximum number of flowers to be returned in the response.

What information is included in the response for a single flower?

The 'findFlowerById' API returns a flower object with properties such as id, name, type, and price.

What data is required to create a new flower using the 'addFlower' API?

To create a new flower, you need to provide a request body with the name, type, and price properties.

How can I delete a flower from the collection?

You can use the 'deleteFlower' API with a DELETE request and provide the ID of the flower you want to delete as a path parameter.

What response codes should I expect from these APIs?

Successful GET requests will return 200, successful POST requests will return 201, successful DELETE requests will return 204, and any errors will return appropriate error codes and messages.

Can I retrieve multiple flowers by their IDs in a single request?

No, the 'findFlowerById' API only allows retrieving a single flower by its ID. To retrieve multiple flowers, you would need to make separate requests for each ID.

Are there any restrictions or limitations on the data I can provide for creating a new flower?

The YAML specification does not mention any specific restrictions or limitations on the data for creating a new flower, but it is recommended to follow best practices and validate the input data on the server side.

What should I do if I encounter an error while using these APIs?

If you encounter an error, the API will return an appropriate error code and a message explaining the issue. You can use this information to troubleshoot and resolve the problem.

Can I update an existing flower using these APIs?

No, these APIs do not provide functionality for updating existing flowers. You would need to delete the existing flower and create a new one with the updated data.

How can I test these APIs before integrating them into my application?

You can use tools like Postman or curl to send sample requests to the APIs and verify the responses. You can also set up a local development environment and run the APIs locally for testing purposes.

Are these APIs designed to handle concurrent requests?

The YAML specification does not provide any information about concurrency handling. However, it is generally recommended to design APIs with concurrency in mind to ensure proper handling of multiple simultaneous requests.

Can I access these APIs from a web browser or are they intended for server-to-server communication?

The YAML specification does not explicitly mention the intended use case for these APIs. However, they can be accessed from a web browser or used for server-to-server communication, depending on the requirements of your application.

How can I ensure the security and authentication of these APIs?

The YAML specification does not provide any details about security or authentication mechanisms. You would need to implement appropriate security measures, such as API keys, OAuth, or JWT tokens, based on your application's requirements and industry best practices.

Can I extend or modify these APIs to add more functionality?

The YAML specification serves as a blueprint for the APIs, and you can potentially extend or modify the APIs based on your application's needs. However, it is important to carefully plan and document any changes to maintain compatibility and avoid breaking existing integrations.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for these APIs?

The YAML specification does not mention any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms. However, it is a common practice to implement such mechanisms to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the APIs.

How can I handle errors related to invalid or missing data in the request?

The APIs should return appropriate error codes and messages when encountering invalid or missing data in the request. You can handle these errors in your application's code by checking the response and taking appropriate actions based on the error information provided.

Can I integrate these APIs with external services or third-party APIs?

The YAML specification does not provide any information about integrating with external services or APIs. However, it is generally possible to integrate APIs with other systems as long as the required data formats and communication protocols are compatible.
