    Description:
    The provided image depicts a set of APIs related to managing flowers. The APIs include functionality for retrieving a list of flowers, getting details of a specific flower by ID, adding a new flower, and deleting a flower by ID. The '/flowers' GET endpoint takes two parameters: 'type' (a string array) to filter flowers by type, and 'limit' (an integer) to limit the number of results. The response is a JSON array containing 'Flower' objects, which have an 'id' property of type integer. The '/flowers/{id}' GET endpoint retrieves details of a specific flower by its ID, with the response being a 'Flower' object. The '/flowers' POST endpoint is used to add a new flower, with the request body containing a 'NewFlower' object with properties like 'name', 'type', and 'price'. The '/flowers/{id}' DELETE endpoint deletes a flower by its ID, with a successful response of status code 204. Possible errors include a generic 'Error' object with 'code' and 'message' properties.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of the '/flowers' GET endpoint?

The '/flowers' GET endpoint is used to retrieve a list of flowers. It accepts two optional parameters: 'type' (a string array) to filter flowers by type, and 'limit' (an integer) to limit the number of results returned.

What does the response of the '/flowers' GET endpoint look like?

The response of the '/flowers' GET endpoint is a JSON array containing 'Flower' objects, which have an 'id' property of type integer.

How can I get details of a specific flower?

To get details of a specific flower, you can use the '/flowers/{id}' GET endpoint, where '{id}' is replaced with the ID of the flower you want to retrieve. The response will be a 'Flower' object containing the details of the requested flower.

What is the purpose of the '/flowers' POST endpoint?

The '/flowers' POST endpoint is used to add a new flower. The request body should contain a 'NewFlower' object with properties like 'name', 'type', and 'price' to specify the details of the new flower.

What does the 'NewFlower' object look like?

The 'NewFlower' object has properties like 'name' (a string), 'type' (a string), and 'price' (a decimal) to specify the details of the new flower being added.

How can I delete a flower?

To delete a flower, you can use the '/flowers/{id}' DELETE endpoint, where '{id}' is replaced with the ID of the flower you want to delete. If successful, the response will have a status code of 204.

What is the purpose of the 'Error' model?

The 'Error' model is used to represent error responses from the APIs. It has properties like 'code' (an integer) and 'message' (a string) to provide more information about the error that occurred.

Can I filter the list of flowers by multiple types?

Yes, you can filter the list of flowers by multiple types using the 'type' parameter of the '/flowers' GET endpoint. The 'type' parameter accepts a string array, so you can provide multiple values to filter by multiple types.

What happens if I try to retrieve a flower with an invalid ID?

If you try to retrieve a flower with an invalid ID using the '/flowers/{id}' GET endpoint, the API will likely return an 'Error' response with an appropriate error code and message.

Is there a way to update the details of an existing flower?

Based on the provided information, there doesn't seem to be an endpoint specifically for updating the details of an existing flower. You would likely need to delete the existing flower and add a new one with the updated details.

What is the expected format for the 'price' property in the 'NewFlower' object?

The 'price' property in the 'NewFlower' object is of type 'decimal', which typically represents a floating-point number with a fixed precision and scale.

Can I retrieve a list of flowers without any filters or limits?

Yes, you can retrieve a list of all flowers without any filters or limits by sending a GET request to the '/flowers' endpoint without providing any values for the 'type' or 'limit' parameters.

What HTTP method is used for the '/flowers/{id}' endpoint?

The '/flowers/{id}' endpoint uses two HTTP methods: GET to retrieve details of a specific flower, and DELETE to delete a flower by its ID.

Is there any validation performed on the 'NewFlower' object when adding a new flower?

The provided information doesn't specify any validation rules for the 'NewFlower' object. However, it's common for APIs to perform validation on request bodies to ensure that the provided data is valid and meets certain constraints.

What happens if I try to delete a flower that doesn't exist?

If you try to delete a flower using the '/flowers/{id}' DELETE endpoint with an ID that doesn't exist, the API will likely return an 'Error' response with an appropriate error code and message indicating that the specified flower was not found.

Can I specify a default value for the 'limit' parameter in the '/flowers' GET endpoint?

The provided information doesn't mention any default value for the 'limit' parameter. However, it's common for APIs to have default values for optional parameters if no value is provided.

Is there any rate limiting or throttling implemented for these APIs?

The provided information doesn't mention any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for these APIs. However, it's a common practice to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

Are there any security considerations or authentication mechanisms for these APIs?

The provided information doesn't mention any security considerations or authentication mechanisms for these APIs. However, it's generally recommended to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for APIs to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data security.

Can I retrieve a list of flowers sorted by a specific property, such as price or name?

The provided information doesn't mention any sorting options for the '/flowers' GET endpoint. However, it's a common feature for APIs to allow sorting of results based on various properties.

Are there any caching mechanisms implemented for these APIs?

The provided information doesn't mention any caching mechanisms for these APIs. However, caching is often implemented to improve performance and reduce the load on the server, especially for frequently accessed or computationally expensive APIs.
