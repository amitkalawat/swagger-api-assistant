    Description:
    The provided images represent a set of RESTful APIs for managing flowers. The APIs allow users to retrieve a list of flowers (`GET /flowers`), get details of a specific flower (`GET /flowers/{id}`), add a new flower (`POST /flowers`), and delete an existing flower (`DELETE /flowers/{id}`). The `GET /flowers` endpoint takes two optional query parameters: `type` (a string array) and `limit` (an integer). The `POST /flowers` endpoint requires a request body with the properties `name`, `type`, and `price`. The `GET /flowers/{id}` and `DELETE /flowers/{id}` endpoints use the `id` path parameter to identify the specific flower resource. Possible error responses include a generic `Error` object with `code` and `message` properties. The `id` property is present in most data models, representing the unique identifier for a flower.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of the APIs represented in the images?

The APIs provide functionality for managing flowers, allowing users to retrieve a list of flowers, get details of a specific flower, add a new flower, and delete an existing flower.

How can I retrieve a list of flowers?

You can use the `GET /flowers` endpoint to retrieve a list of flowers. This endpoint supports optional query parameters `type` (a string array) and `limit` (an integer) to filter and limit the results.

What data is required to add a new flower?

To add a new flower, you need to make a `POST` request to the `/flowers` endpoint with a request body containing the properties `name`, `type`, and `price`.

How can I get the details of a specific flower?

You can use the `GET /flowers/{id}` endpoint to get the details of a specific flower, where `{id}` is the unique identifier of the flower you want to retrieve.

What is the expected response format for retrieving a list of flowers?

The expected response format for retrieving a list of flowers is an array of `Flower` objects, where each `Flower` object has properties such as `id`, `name`, `type`, and `price`.

How can I delete an existing flower?

To delete an existing flower, you need to make a `DELETE` request to the `/flowers/{id}` endpoint, where `{id}` is the unique identifier of the flower you want to delete.

What is the expected response format when deleting a flower?

The expected response format when deleting a flower is a `deleteFlower` object with an `id` property representing the unique identifier of the deleted flower.

What happens if an error occurs during the API request?

If an error occurs during the API request, the response will contain an `Error` object with `code` and `message` properties providing information about the error.

Can I filter the list of flowers by type?

Yes, you can filter the list of flowers by type using the `type` query parameter in the `GET /flowers` endpoint. The `type` parameter accepts a string array of flower types.

What is the purpose of the `limit` query parameter in the `GET /flowers` endpoint?

The `limit` query parameter in the `GET /flowers` endpoint allows you to limit the number of flowers returned in the response, which can be useful for pagination or limiting the amount of data transferred.

Are there any required properties when retrieving a list of flowers?

No, there are no required properties when retrieving a list of flowers using the `GET /flowers` endpoint. The `type` and `limit` query parameters are optional.

What is the data type of the `id` property in the various data models?

The `id` property in the `Flower`, `NewFlower`, `findFlowerById`, and `deleteFlower` data models is of type `integer`, representing a unique identifier for a flower.

Can I update an existing flower using these APIs?

Based on the provided information, there is no endpoint or functionality shown for updating an existing flower. The APIs only cover retrieving, adding, and deleting flowers.

What is the expected HTTP status code for a successful response when adding a new flower?

The expected HTTP status code for a successful response when adding a new flower is not explicitly shown in the provided information. However, based on RESTful API conventions, a successful `POST` request typically returns a 201 Created status code.

Is there any validation or error handling for invalid or missing data in the request body when adding a new flower?

The provided information does not specify any validation or error handling for invalid or missing data in the request body when adding a new flower using the `POST /flowers` endpoint. This would typically be implemented on the server-side and documented in the API specification.

What is the expected HTTP method for retrieving a list of flowers?

The expected HTTP method for retrieving a list of flowers is `GET`, as shown by the `GET /flowers` endpoint in the provided information.

Can I use these APIs to manage other types of resources besides flowers?

Based on the provided information, these APIs are specifically designed for managing flowers. There is no indication that they can be used to manage other types of resources.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for these APIs?

The provided information does not mention any rate limits or throttling mechanisms for these APIs. However, it is a common practice to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

What is the purpose of the `NewFlower` data model?

The `NewFlower` data model represents the structure of the request body required when adding a new flower using the `POST /flowers` endpoint. It includes properties such as `name`, `type`, and `price`.

Is there any support for authentication or authorization in these APIs?

The provided information does not mention any authentication or authorization mechanisms for these APIs. However, in production environments, it is common to implement authentication and authorization to secure the APIs and control access.
