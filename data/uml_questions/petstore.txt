    Description:
    This set of APIs allows for managing pets in a system. The main API endpoints are: GET /pets to retrieve a list of pets, GET /pets/{id} to get details of a specific pet by its ID, POST /pets to add a new pet, and DELETE /pets/{id} to remove a pet by its ID. The GET /pets endpoint takes optional query parameters tags (an array of strings for filtering pets by tags) and limit (an integer for limiting the number of results). The POST /pets request body should contain a NewPet object with name (string) and tag (array of strings) properties. Successful responses include a 200 status code and the requested data. Error responses include a 400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found status along with an Error object containing code (integer) and message (string) properties. The diagram shows the various request/response data models involved.
    ['- Number of routes/endpoints: 4 (GET /pets, GET /pets/{id}, POST /pets, DELETE /pets/{id})', '- Number of request data models: 2 (tags, limit query params for GET /pets and NewPet object for POST /pets)', '- Number of response data models: 3 (Pet array for GET /pets, Pet for GET /pets/{id}, and Error)', '- Two types of status codes are shown: 200 (Success) and 204 (No Content for DELETE)', '- The Pet data model has two properties: id (integer) and Pet.1 which likely represents additional pet details']

Can I filter the list of pets by tags?

How do I get details of a specific pet?

What data is required to add a new pet?

To add a new pet, you need to send a POST request to the /pets endpoint with a request body containing a NewPet object. The NewPet object should have a name (string) and tag (array of strings) property.

How do I remove a pet from the system?

To remove a pet from the system, you can send a DELETE request to the /pets/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the pet you want to remove. For example: DELETE /pets/123

What kind of errors can I expect from this API?

This API can return a 400 Bad Request error with an Error object containing a code and message property. It can also return a 404 Not Found error if the requested pet ID doesn't exist.

What data types are used in the request and response models?

The API uses string, integer, and array data types in the request and response models. For example, the tags query parameter is an array of strings, the limit query parameter is an integer, and the Pet model has an id property of type integer.

Can I update an existing pet's details?

Based on the provided information, there doesn't seem to be an endpoint for updating an existing pet's details. The API only supports retrieving, adding, and removing pets.

What happens if I send an invalid request body when adding a new pet?

If you send an invalid request body when adding a new pet (e.g., missing required fields or incorrect data types), the API is likely to return a 400 Bad Request error with an Error object containing details about the error.

How can I handle errors returned by the API?

When the API returns an error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found), it includes an Error object in the response body. This Error object contains a code (integer) and message (string) property that you can use to handle and troubleshoot the error.

Is there a way to retrieve pets based on multiple tags?

Yes, you can retrieve pets based on multiple tags by including multiple tag values in the tags query parameter of the GET /pets request, separated by commas. For example: GET /pets?tags=dog,cat,bird

What happens if I try to remove a pet that doesn't exist?

If you try to remove a pet by sending a DELETE request to /pets/{id} with an ID that doesn't exist, the API is likely to return a 404 Not Found error with an Error object containing details about the error.

Can I include additional data when adding a new pet?

Based on the provided information, the only data required when adding a new pet is the name (string) and tag (array of strings) properties in the NewPet request body. There doesn't seem to be a way to include additional data.

How can I handle pagination for the list of pets?

The API provides a limit query parameter that you can use to limit the number of results returned in the GET /pets response. You can use this parameter in combination with other techniques (e.g., offset or cursor-based pagination) to handle pagination for the list of pets.

Is there a way to sort the list of pets?

Based on the provided information, there doesn't seem to be a way to sort the list of pets returned by the GET /pets endpoint. The API only supports filtering by tags and limiting the number of results.

What is the maximum number of tags I can include in the tags query parameter?

The provided information doesn't specify a maximum number of tags that can be included in the tags query parameter for the GET /pets request. However, there are likely practical limits based on factors such as server memory and processing power.

Can I include additional metadata when removing a pet?

No, the provided information doesn't mention the ability to include additional metadata when removing a pet. The DELETE /pets/{id} endpoint only requires the pet ID in the URL path.

How can I test this API during development?

During development, you can use tools like Postman, curl, or language-specific HTTP clients to send requests to the API endpoints and inspect the responses. You can also set up test cases or use API testing frameworks to automate testing.
