    Description:
    This OpenAPI specification defines a set of APIs for managing pets. The APIs include GET /pets which retrieves a list of pets with optional filtering by tags and limit, GET /pets/{id} which retrieves a specific pet by its ID, POST /pets which adds a new pet with a provided name and tag, and DELETE /pets/{id} which deletes a pet by its ID. The requests and responses use standard HTTP status codes and data structures containing properties like id, name, tag, limit, and error details (code and message). Potential errors include situations where a pet is not found or invalid input is provided.

- Number of request data models: 2 (NewPet, Path)
- Number of response data models: 3 (Response, Pet, Error)

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of these APIs?

These APIs are designed for managing pets, allowing you to retrieve a list of pets, get details of a specific pet, add a new pet, and delete an existing pet.

How do I retrieve a list of pets?

Use the GET /pets endpoint. You can optionally filter the list by providing tags and a limit in the request parameters.

What data is returned when I retrieve a list of pets?

The response will contain a list of Pet objects, each containing the pet's id and other details like name and tag (if available).

How do I get details of a specific pet?

Use the GET /pets/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the pet you want to retrieve.

What happens if I try to retrieve a pet that doesn't exist?

If the requested pet ID does not exist, you will receive an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 404 Not Found) and an Error object in the response containing details about the error.

How do I add a new pet?

Use the POST /pets endpoint and include a NewPet object in the request body containing the name and tag (optional) of the new pet you want to add.

What data is required when adding a new pet?

The only required field when adding a new pet is the name. The tag field is optional.

How do I delete an existing pet?

Use the DELETE /pets/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the pet you want to delete.

What happens if I try to delete a pet that doesn't exist?

If the requested pet ID does not exist, you will receive an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 404 Not Found) and an Error object in the response containing details about the error.

Can I filter the list of pets by multiple tags?

The specification does not provide details on whether multiple tags can be used for filtering. It is recommended to check the API documentation or try different combinations of tags to see how the API handles them.

Are there any limits on the number of pets I can retrieve?

The specification mentions a limit parameter for the GET /pets endpoint, but it does not specify the maximum value allowed. Check the API documentation or try different limit values to understand the restrictions, if any.

What HTTP status codes can I expect from these APIs?

The specification does not provide explicit details on HTTP status codes. However, you can generally expect standard status codes like 200 OK for successful requests, 4xx for client errors (e.g., 404 Not Found), and 5xx for server errors.

Can I update an existing pet's details?

The provided specification does not include an endpoint for updating pet details. It only covers retrieving, adding, and deleting pets.

Are there any authentication or authorization requirements for using these APIs?

The specification does not mention any authentication or authorization requirements. It is possible that additional security measures may be implemented, so it is recommended to check the API documentation for more information.

How can I handle errors returned by these APIs?

The specification indicates that errors will be returned as an Error object in the response, containing a code and a message. You can handle errors by checking the HTTP status code and parsing the Error object to understand the cause of the error.

Can I add multiple tags when creating a new pet?

The specification shows that the tag field in the NewPet object is a single string value, so it appears that only one tag can be added when creating a new pet.

What data format is used for the requests and responses?

The specification does not explicitly mention the data format, but based on the provided examples and conventions, it is likely that JSON is used for both requests and responses.

Are there any special characters or formatting requirements for the pet name or tag?

The specification does not provide any details on character restrictions or formatting requirements for the pet name or tag fields. It is recommended to check the API documentation or try different values to understand any potential limitations.

Can I use these APIs to manage pets for multiple users or accounts?

The specification does not mention any user or account-specific functionality. It appears to be a general pet management API without any multi-user or multi-account support. However, the actual implementation may include additional features not covered in the provided specification.

Are there any built-in mechanisms for pagination or sorting when retrieving a list of pets?

The specification does not mention any pagination or sorting mechanisms for the GET /pets endpoint. It is possible that additional query parameters or headers may be supported for these functionalities, but they are not documented in the provided specification.
