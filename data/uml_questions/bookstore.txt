    Description:
    The given images represent the specification for a set of RESTful APIs related to books and authors. The APIs allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and authors. The book APIs include GET /books to list all books, GET /books/{bookId} to retrieve a specific book, POST /books to create a new book, PUT /books/{bookId} to update an existing book, and DELETE /books/{bookId} to delete a book. The book data model includes properties like id, title, description, and published date. The author APIs include GET /authors to list all authors, GET /authors/{authorId} to retrieve a specific author, POST /authors to create a new author, PUT /authors/{authorId} to update an existing author, and DELETE /authors/{authorId} to delete an author. The author data model includes properties like id, name, and biography. The APIs follow RESTful conventions and use standard HTTP methods and response codes. Possible errors or limits may include validations for required fields, maximum lengths, date formats, etc.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of these APIs?

These APIs allow management of books and authors, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting book and author records.

How do I retrieve a list of all books?

To retrieve a list of all books, send a GET request to the '/books' endpoint.

What data is required to create a new book?

To create a new book, send a POST request to the '/books' endpoint with a JSON request body containing the required fields: title (string), authorId (integer), description (string), and published (date).

How do I update an existing author's information?

To update an existing author, send a PUT request to the '/authors/{authorId}' endpoint with the authorId in the URL path and a JSON request body containing the updated fields, such as name (string) or biography (string).

What happens if I try to delete a book that doesn't exist?

If you send a DELETE request to '/books/{bookId}' with a bookId that doesn't exist, the API will likely return a 404 Not Found error.

Can I retrieve a specific book by its title?

No, these APIs do not provide an endpoint to retrieve a book by its title. You can only retrieve a book by its unique bookId using the '/books/{bookId}' endpoint.

What data is included in the response when retrieving a book?

When retrieving a book using the GET '/books/{bookId}' endpoint, the response includes the book's id, title, description, authorId, and published date.

Are there any validations on the input data for creating or updating books/authors?

Yes, the APIs likely have validations in place to ensure required fields are provided, data types are correct (e.g., integer for IDs), and data formats are valid (e.g., date formats). Specific validation rules may vary.

How do I handle errors or exceptional cases when using these APIs?

The APIs follow RESTful conventions and should return appropriate HTTP status codes for error cases, such as 400 Bad Request for validation errors, 404 Not Found for non-existent resources, and 500 Internal Server Error for server-side issues. Check the response codes and messages for error details.

Can I retrieve an author's books along with their information?

No, these APIs do not provide a specific endpoint to retrieve an author's books together with their information. You would need to first retrieve the author using GET '/authors/{authorId}', and then retrieve each of their books separately using GET '/books/{bookId}'.

What is the purpose of the BookInput and AuthorInput data models?

The BookInput and AuthorInput data models represent the request body structure for creating or updating books and authors, respectively. They define the fields that need to be provided in the request payload.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for these APIs?

The provided information does not specify any rate limits or throttling mechanisms. However, it is a common practice to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of APIs.

How do I handle scenarios where an author needs to be deleted, but they have associated books?

The provided information does not specify any specific handling for this scenario. In a real-world application, you may need to implement additional logic to handle such cases, such as preventing author deletion if they have associated books, or providing a way to reassign or delete the associated books before deleting the author.

Can I search for books or authors using keywords or filters?

No, the provided APIs do not include any endpoints or functionality for searching or filtering books or authors based on keywords or specific criteria. The APIs only support basic CRUD operations.

What HTTP methods are used for each type of operation (create, read, update, delete)?

The APIs follow RESTful conventions: POST is used for creating new resources (books or authors), GET is used for retrieving resources, PUT is used for updating existing resources, and DELETE is used for deleting resources.

Are there any sorting or pagination features available for listing books or authors?

The provided information does not mention any sorting or pagination features for the list endpoints (GET '/books' and GET '/authors'). The responses may return all available resources without any sorting or pagination options.

How do I handle scenarios where multiple clients try to update the same book or author concurrently?

The provided information does not specify any mechanisms for handling concurrent updates. In a real-world application, you may need to implement additional logic, such as locking mechanisms, versioning, or conflict resolution strategies, to handle concurrent updates and ensure data integrity.

Are there any authentication or authorization mechanisms in place for these APIs?

The provided information does not mention any authentication or authorization mechanisms. In a production environment, you would typically implement authentication (e.g., API keys, JWT tokens) and authorization mechanisms to secure access to the APIs and control permissions for different operations.

Can I batch multiple operations (create, update, delete) in a single API request?

No, the provided APIs do not support batch operations. Each API endpoint is designed to perform a single operation (create, read, update, or delete) for a single resource (book or author).

Are there any caching mechanisms in place for frequently accessed data?

The provided information does not mention any caching mechanisms. In a real-world application, you may consider implementing caching strategies, such as in-memory caching or caching at the API gateway level, to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
