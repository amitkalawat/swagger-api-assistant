    Description:
    This API provides functionality for working with datasets. There are two main endpoints: GET /datasets to list available datasets, and POST /dataset/{version}/records to perform a search within a specific dataset version. The GET /datasets endpoint returns a simple list of dataset names. The POST /dataset/{version}/records endpoint takes a dataset and version as path parameters, and a request body containing search criteria (criteria, start index, and number of rows). The response for a successful search (200 OK) includes a map containing the search results. If the request is invalid (e.g. non-existent dataset/version), a 404 error response is returned with a string value indicating the error.
    - Number of routes/endpoints: 2 (GET /datasets, POST /dataset/{version}/records)
- Number of request data models: 1 (perform-search Request)
- Number of response data models: 3 (list-searchable-fields 200, list-searchable-fields 404, perform-search 200/404)
- The API has a separate data model for capturing dataset metadata (dataSetList.apis)
    
    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this API?

This API allows clients to list available datasets and perform searches within specific dataset versions.

How do I get a list of available datasets?

Send a GET request to the /datasets endpoint. The response will contain a list of dataset names.

How do I perform a search within a dataset?

Send a POST request to the /dataset/{version}/records endpoint, replacing {version} with the desired dataset version. Include a request body with the search criteria, such as filters, start index, and number of rows.

What does the request body for a search look like?

The request body for a search should be a JSON object with the following properties: criteria (string), start (integer), rows (integer). For example: {"criteria": "city=Seattle", "start": 0, "rows": 10}

What is returned in the response for a successful search?

The response for a successful search (status code 200) contains a map with the search results under the 'value' key.

What happens if I try to search a non-existent dataset or version?

If the requested dataset or version does not exist, the API will return a 404 error response with a string value indicating the error.

How do I interpret the 'list-searchable-fields' responses?

The 'list-searchable-fields' responses provide metadata about the searchable fields in a dataset. A 200 response includes the field names, while a 404 response indicates an invalid dataset/version.

Is there a way to get documentation or metadata about the datasets?

Yes, the API includes a 'dataSetList.apis' data model that contains metadata about each dataset, such as the API key, version number, URLs, and documentation URLs.

Are there any limits on the number of search results I can retrieve?

The 'rows' parameter in the search request body allows you to specify the maximum number of results to return. However, the API documentation does not mention any hard limits.

How do I handle errors or invalid responses from the API?

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure. A 404 response indicates an invalid request, such as a non-existent dataset or version. Check the response body for any error messages or descriptions.

Can I search across multiple datasets or versions at once?

No, the API requires you to specify a single dataset and version for each search request. To search across multiple datasets or versions, you would need to make separate requests.

Is there any way to filter the list of datasets returned by the GET /datasets endpoint?

No, the documentation does not indicate any filtering or sorting capabilities for the list of datasets. The endpoint simply returns the full list of dataset names.

How do I authenticate or authorize access to this API?

The documentation does not provide any details about authentication or authorization mechanisms for this API. It may require an API key or other credentials to be passed in the request headers.

Can I perform more complex searches beyond simple filtering?

The documentation does not mention any advanced search capabilities beyond the 'criteria' filter parameter. Complex searches may not be supported by this API.

Are there any best practices or recommendations for efficient usage of this API?

Without more context about the API's intended usage or performance characteristics, it's difficult to provide specific best practices. General recommendations would be to minimize the number of requests, leverage caching where possible, and avoid requesting more data than necessary.

How do I stay updated on any changes or updates to this API?

The documentation does not mention any change management processes or update notifications for this API. You may need to refer to additional resources or contact the API provider for information on updates or breaking changes.

Are there any tools or libraries available for interacting with this API?

The documentation does not reference any official tools, SDKs, or client libraries for this API. Developers may need to use general-purpose HTTP clients or create their own library for interacting with the API.

How does this API handle data security and privacy?

There are no details provided in the documentation about data security, encryption, or privacy measures implemented by this API. Ensuring proper data handling would depend on the specific datasets and their contents.

Can I get sample data or example responses from this API for testing purposes?

The documentation does not include any sample data or example responses. You may need to make actual requests against the API endpoints to obtain example data for testing and development purposes.

Are there any monitoring or logging capabilities available for this API?

The documentation does not mention any monitoring, logging, or analytics features for this API. Implementing logging or monitoring would likely require custom integration with external tools or services.
