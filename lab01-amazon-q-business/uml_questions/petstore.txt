    Description:
    The API set provided allows for managing pets in a system. The main functionalities include finding pets based on tags and limits, adding new pets with names and tags, and deleting pets by their ID. The API has a 'GET /pets' endpoint that retrieves a list of pets, taking 'tags' and 'limit' as optional query parameters. The response is a '200 OK' with an array of 'Pet' objects containing 'id' fields. There is a 'GET /pets/{id}' endpoint that retrieves a specific pet by its ID, responding with '200 OK' and a 'Pet' object or '404 Not Found' if the pet is not found. The 'POST /pets' endpoint allows adding a new pet, taking a request body with 'name' and 'tag' fields, and responding with '201 Created' and the new 'Pet' object. The 'DELETE /pets/{id}' endpoint deletes a pet by its ID, responding with '204 No Content' on success or '404 Not Found' if the pet is not found. There is an 'Error' response model with 'code' and 'message' fields that may be returned in case of errors.
