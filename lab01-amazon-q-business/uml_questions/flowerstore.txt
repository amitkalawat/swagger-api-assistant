    Description:
    The provided YAML file specifies a set of APIs for managing flowers. The API has four endpoints: GET /flowers, GET /flowers/{id}, POST /flowers, and DELETE /flowers/{id}. The GET /flowers endpoint retrieves a list of flowers with optional query parameters for filtering the path and limiting the number of results. The GET /flowers/{id} endpoint retrieves details of a specific flower by its id. The POST /flowers endpoint allows adding a new flower with the name, type, and price provided in the request body. The DELETE /flowers/{id} endpoint deletes a flower by its id. The API handles errors with an Error response containing a code and message. The Flower and NewFlower data models define the structure of flower data.
    ['- Number of routes/endpoints: 4', '- Number of request data models: 1 (NewFlower)', '- Number of response data models: 3 (Flower, Error, Response)', '- Maximum number of results that can be retrieved: 200 (limit query parameter)']
    
    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this API?

This API allows clients to manage a collection of flowers by retrieving, adding, and deleting flower data.

How do I get a list of all available flowers?

Send a GET request to the /flowers endpoint. You can optionally filter the results by providing the path query parameter and limit the number of results using the limit query parameter.

How do I retrieve details of a specific flower?

Send a GET request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the flower you want to retrieve.

What data is required to add a new flower?

To add a new flower, send a POST request to the /flowers endpoint with a request body containing the name, type, and price properties of the new flower.

How do I delete a flower?

Send a DELETE request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the flower you want to delete.

What happens if I try to retrieve a flower that doesn't exist?

If you request a flower ID that doesn't exist, the API will return an Error response with an appropriate error code and message.

What is the maximum number of results I can retrieve from the GET /flowers endpoint?

The maximum number of results you can retrieve is limited to 200 by the limit query parameter.

Can I filter the list of flowers by their type?

No, the API does not provide a way to filter the list of flowers by their type. You can only filter by the path using the path query parameter.

What data format should I use for the price when adding a new flower?

The price should be provided as a decimal value in the request body when adding a new flower using the POST /flowers endpoint.

How do I handle errors returned by the API?

The API returns an Error response with a code and message properties when an error occurs. You should check the response for an Error object and handle the error accordingly based on the provided code and message.

Can I update an existing flower's details?

No, the API does not provide an endpoint for updating an existing flower's details. You can only retrieve, add, or delete flowers.

What is the purpose of the path query parameter in the GET /flowers endpoint?

The path query parameter allows you to filter the list of flowers returned by the GET /flowers endpoint based on a specific path.

Are there any restrictions on the naming conventions for flower names and types?

The YAML file does not specify any restrictions on the naming conventions for flower names and types. However, it's generally a good practice to follow standard naming conventions for string values.

How do I know if a request was successful or not?

If a request is successful, the API will return the appropriate response object (e.g., a list of Flower objects or a single Flower object). If an error occurs, the API will return an Error response with an error code and message.

Can I use this API to manage other types of plants besides flowers?

No, this API is specifically designed to manage a collection of flowers. It does not support managing other types of plants.

Is there a way to sort the list of flowers returned by the GET /flowers endpoint?

The YAML file does not specify any sorting capabilities for the GET /flowers endpoint. The list of flowers is likely returned in the order they are stored in the underlying data source.

What happens if I try to add a flower with invalid data?

If you send a POST request to the /flowers endpoint with invalid data (e.g., missing required properties or invalid data formats), the API will likely return an Error response indicating the issue with the request data.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for this API?

The YAML file does not mention any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms. However, it's a common practice for APIs to implement such mechanisms to prevent abuse or excessive load.

How can I test this API without affecting production data?

The YAML file does not provide any information about testing or development environments. It's recommended to follow best practices and have separate environments for testing and development purposes to avoid affecting production data.

Is there any documentation or examples available for this API?

The YAML file itself serves as the documentation for this API, specifying the endpoints, request/response data structures, and other details. However, it does not provide any additional documentation or examples.
