    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this API?

This API provides functionality for managing book and author data. It allows creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting book and author records.

How do I create a new book record?

To create a new book record, send a POST request to the `/books` endpoint with a request body containing the required fields like `title`, `authorId`, `description`, and `published` (date).

What data is returned when retrieving a book?

When retrieving a book record using the GET method on the `/books/{bookId}` endpoint, the response will contain the book's `id`, `title`, `description`, `published` date, and the `authorId`.

How do I update an existing author's information?

To update an author's information, send a PUT request to the `/authors/{authorId}` endpoint with a request body containing the updated `name` and `biography` fields.

What happens if I try to retrieve a non-existent book or author?

If you try to retrieve a book or author with an ID that does not exist, the API will likely return a 404 Not Found error.

Can I retrieve a list of all available books or authors?

Yes, you can retrieve a list of all available books by sending a GET request to the `/books` endpoint, and a list of all authors by sending a GET request to the `/authors` endpoint.

What are the required fields when creating a new author?

To create a new author, you need to send a POST request to the `/authors` endpoint with a request body containing at least the `name` field. The `biography` field is optional.

How do I delete a book record?

To delete a book record, send a DELETE request to the `/books/{bookId}` endpoint, replacing `{bookId}` with the ID of the book you want to delete.

What validation is performed on the input data?

The API likely performs validation on the input data to ensure that required fields are present and that the data adheres to the expected formats and constraints. For example, it may validate that the `title` field is not empty when creating a new book.

Can I retrieve information about an author associated with a book?

No, this API does not provide a direct way to retrieve author information associated with a book. You would need to first retrieve the `authorId` from the book record, and then make a separate request to the `/authors/{authorId}` endpoint to retrieve the author's information.

What HTTP status codes can I expect from the API?

Common HTTP status codes you can expect include 200 OK for successful GET, PUT, and DELETE requests, 201 Created for successful POST requests, 400 Bad Request for invalid input data, 404 Not Found for non-existent resources, and potentially others like 500 Internal Server Error for unexpected errors.

How do I handle errors returned by the API?

The API is likely to return error information in the response body or headers. You should handle different HTTP status codes appropriately and parse any error messages or codes returned in the response to take appropriate action.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place?

The API documentation does not mention any specific rate limits or throttling mechanisms. However, it is a common practice for APIs to implement such measures to prevent abuse or overload. You should be prepared to handle rate limiting errors if encountered.

Can I update the `id` or `authorId` fields of a book record?

No, the `id` and `authorId` fields of a book record are likely immutable and cannot be updated directly. If you need to change the associated author for a book, you would need to create a new book record with the desired `authorId`.

How can I filter or search for books or authors based on specific criteria?

The API documentation does not mention any built-in filtering or search capabilities. You would need to retrieve the complete list of books or authors and perform filtering or searching on the client-side based on your specific requirements.

Is there a way to batch create or update multiple books or authors in a single request?

The API documentation does not mention any batch operations. It appears that you would need to create, update, or delete books and authors individually using separate requests.

Can I set up webhooks or callbacks to receive notifications about changes to book or author data?

The API documentation does not mention any webhook or callback functionality. It appears to be a standard REST API without support for real-time notifications or event-driven architectures.

Are there any built-in mechanisms for handling concurrent modifications to the same resource?

The API documentation does not provide information about concurrency control mechanisms. Depending on the implementation, there may or may not be built-in mechanisms to handle concurrent modifications to the same book or author record.

Can I access or modify the API's configuration or settings through the provided endpoints?

No, the API documentation does not mention any endpoints or functionality for accessing or modifying the API's configuration or settings. It appears to be a standard resource-oriented API without administrative or management capabilities exposed.

How can I authenticate and authorize requests to the API?

The API documentation does not provide any information about authentication or authorization mechanisms. Without additional details, it is unclear if the API requires any form of authentication or authorization, or if it is open and accessible without credentials.
