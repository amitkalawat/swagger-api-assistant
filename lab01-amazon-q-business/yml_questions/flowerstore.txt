    Description:
    The Flowershop API is a set of APIs designed to manage the operations of a flower shop. It provides endpoints to retrieve a list of available flowers, add new flowers to the shop, fetch details of a specific flower, and delete a flower from the shop.

The GET /flowers endpoint returns a list of flowers available in the shop. It supports optional query parameters to filter the results by flower type and limit the number of results returned. The response is an array of Flower objects, which contain properties such as name, type, price, and id.

The POST /flowers endpoint allows you to add a new flower to the shop. It expects a NewFlower object in the request body, which requires the name, type, and price of the flower. The response contains the newly created Flower object, including the assigned id.

The GET /flowers/{id} endpoint retrieves the details of a specific flower by its id. The id is provided as a path parameter, and the response contains the Flower object for the requested id.

The DELETE /flowers/{id} endpoint removes a flower from the shop by its id. The id is provided as a path parameter, and the response is a 204 No Content status code upon successful deletion.

All endpoints include error handling and return an Error object with a code and message in case of an unexpected error.

One potential limitation is that the APIs do not include authentication or authorization mechanisms, which may be necessary for production use. Additionally, the APIs do not support updating existing flower details or handling inventory or stock levels.
