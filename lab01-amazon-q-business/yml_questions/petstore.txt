    Description:
    This OpenAPI specification defines a set of APIs for managing pets in a pet store system. The main APIs include:

1. GET /pets: Retrieves a list of all pets that the user has access to. It supports filtering by tags and limiting the number of results. The response is an array of `Pet` objects.

2. POST /pets: Creates a new pet in the store. The request body should include a `NewPet` object with the required `name` property and an optional `tag` property. The response is the newly created `Pet` object.

3. GET /pets/{id}: Retrieves a specific pet by its ID. The `id` parameter is required and should be an integer in int64 format. The response is the `Pet` object. If the user does not have access to the pet, an error is returned.

4. DELETE /pets/{id}: Deletes a specific pet by its ID. The `id` parameter is required and should be an integer in int64 format. If the operation is successful, a 204 No Content response is returned. Otherwise, an error is returned.

The data models used in the APIs are:

- `Pet`: Represents a pet object with an `id` (required, integer in int64 format), `name` (required, string), and `tag` (optional, string).
- `NewPet`: Represents a new pet object with only the `name` (required, string) and `tag` (optional, string) properties.
- `Error`: Represents an error object with a `code` (required, integer in int32 format) and `message` (required, string).

Common errors that may be encountered include:

- 404 Not Found: When a requested pet ID is not found.
- 400 Bad Request: When the request data is invalid or missing required fields.
