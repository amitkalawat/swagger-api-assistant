    Description:
    This is a set of APIs for managing users, repositories, and pull requests on a Git-based version control platform. The APIs provide endpoints for retrieving user information, listing repositories owned by a user, getting details of a specific repository, listing pull requests for a repository, getting details of a specific pull request, and merging a pull request.

The `/2.0/users/{username}` endpoint accepts a `username` parameter and returns the user object with properties like `username` and `uuid`. The response includes a link to fetch the user's repositories.

The `/2.0/repositories/{username}` endpoint accepts a `username` parameter and returns an array of repository objects owned by the user. Each repository object has properties like `slug` and `owner` (user object). The response includes a link to fetch details of a specific repository.

The `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}` endpoint accepts `username` and `slug` parameters and returns the repository object for the specified repository. The response includes a link to fetch pull requests for the repository.

The `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests` endpoint accepts `username` and `slug` parameters, and an optional `state` query parameter to filter pull requests by state (open, merged, or declined). It returns an array of pull request objects.

The `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}` endpoint accepts `username`, `slug`, and `pid` (pull request ID) parameters and returns the pull request object for the specified pull request. The response includes a link to merge the pull request.

The `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}/merge` endpoint accepts `username`, `slug`, and `pid` parameters and merges the specified pull request when a POST request is made. It returns a 204 status code if the merge is successful.

The request and response data structures follow the provided schemas for `user`, `repository`, and `pullrequest` objects.

Possible errors and limits include invalid or missing parameters, unauthorized access, and resource not found scenarios.
